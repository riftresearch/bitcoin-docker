## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> [!TIP]
> We recommend running this on an SSD for faster load times. Initialization of `bitcoind` can take **forever** on an HDD!

- Ideally a fresh install (not required, but HIGHLY recommended).
- A 64 bit linux based server.
- Access to the server through ssh.
- Git [installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).
- Python [installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Docker compose [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Free storage space of 1.5TB or over.
- A folder for your docker containers.
- Relevant permissions to that folder in order to run bash scripts.

### Installation

This stack works out of the box with no editing. Consider making modifications to make the script more secure.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/JDsnyke/crypto/wiki) for additional configuration options.

1. SSH into the server using your credentials.

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

2. Install the dependencies if you haven't already. An example using the APT package manager is shown below.

```bash
sudo apt install git python3 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

3. Navigate to your docker container folder.

```bash
cd example_docker_folder
```

4. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JDsnyke/crypto.git
```

5. Double check the permissions for the folder, the parent folder, and its subfolders. An example of setting permissions for your folders is shown below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of version [`v.1.2.0`](https://github.com/JDsnyke/crypto/releases/tag/v.1.2.0), the permissions **should** be fine by default.

```bash
cd ..
```

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 example_docker_folder
```

```bash
chmod -R 770 example_docker_folder
```

```bash
ls -l
```

6. Go into the new `crypto` folder.

```bash
cd example_docker_folder
```

```bash
cd crypto
```

7. Edit the execution permissions for the `start.sh` script.

```bash
chmod u+x start.sh
```

8. Edit the `start.sh` script using your favorite text editor (e.g. vim, nano, vscode, etc). You want to modify the following variables.

> [!TIP]
> Feel free to use the local and offline [password generation tool](./scripts/password-generator/index.html) bundled with the script!

```bash
STACK_BITCOIND_USERNAME="yourfavusername"
STACK_BITCOIND_PASSWORD="yourbitcoinpasswordd"
STACK_TOR_PASSWORD="yourtorpasswordd"
```

9. Run the script.

```bash
./start.sh
```

10. Visit your active containers!

    [![Bitcoin Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bitcoin%20Node-orange.svg)](http://localhost:3005)
    [![Electrum Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/Electrum%20Server-blue.svg)](http://localhost:3006)
    [![Mempool Explorer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mempool%20Explorer-purple.svg)](http://localhost:3007)

11. Give the bitcoin node time to download fully. This can take days to weeks.

> [!TIP]
> If you using an HDD, this can take much longer and be slower to initialize.

12. Stop the stack.

```bash
./stop.sh
```

### Installation on Synology NAS

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to issues with Synology, Docker and user permissions, the only way this works is to be run as 'root'.

1. SSH into the server using your credentials.

```bash
ssh user@synology.local
```

2. Install the dependencies if you haven't already. For Synology this would be `Container Manager`, `Python` and `Git` (using the [SynoComunity](https://synocommunity.com) repo) through the package manager on the web dashboard.

3. Navigate to your docker container folder on your terminal.

```bash
cd example_docker_folder
```

4. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JDsnyke/crypto.git
```

6. Go into the new `crypto` folder, and update the usernames / passwords on the `start.sh` file as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `Text Editor` in the web interface to edit files and values as needed!

7. Edit the `docker-bitcoin.yml` file in the `compose` folder as below, and save.

From,

```yaml
volumes:
  - "../volumes/bitcoin/node:/data/.bitcoin"
```

To,

```yaml
volumes:
  - "../volumes/bitcoin/node:/root/.bitcoin"
```

7. In the terminal, run the `start.sh` script. Enter your account password when prompted.

```bash
sudo bash start.sh
```

8. Stop the stack using the `stop.sh` script. Enter your account password when prompted.

```bash
sudo bash stop.sh
```

### Updates

1. Check for updates using the `start.sh` script argument.

```bash
./start.sh --check
```

2. If an update is available, run the `update.sh` script file.

```bash
./update.sh
```

## Switching the Mempool Explorer

By default, the lighter [BTC RPC Explorer](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/btc-rpc-explorer) is used.

If you wish, you may swap the the bundled [Mempool Space Explorer](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/mempool) instead.

1. Edit the `start.sh` script file's environment variable.

```bash
STACK_RUN_MEMPOOL_SPACE="True" # From False
```

## Lightning Node

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's recommended that you run the `start.sh` script normally without the lightning node first.

> [!CAUTION]
> The bitcoin node must be **fully** synced to avoid issues with the lightning node.

1. Edit the `start.sh` script file's environment variable (recommended) or run the file with the the appropriate argument.

```bash
STACK_RUN_LIGHTNING_SERVER="True" # From False
```

**OR**

```bash
./start.sh --lightning
```

2. Visit the Umbrel LND container.

   [![Lightning Node](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lightning%20Node-green.svg)](http://localhost:3008)

3. Follow the prompts and create a new wallet.

## Extra Containers

> [!TIP]
> Feel free to add requests to the relevant [discussions](https://github.com/JDsnyke/crypto/discussions/6) board.

I am working on adding additional containers to the script. You will be able to toggle what you want!
